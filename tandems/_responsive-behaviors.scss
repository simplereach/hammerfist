// Responsive Style Mixin
// This mixin requires an external settings map for "breakpoints"
// This mixin takes in a named breakpoint and outputs a proper media-query for
// that particular breakpoint style, working in a "mobile-first" method to
// progressively change the element styles
// ...............................................
@mixin responsive-style-at($name) {
  // Conditional check for named breakpoint in $breakpoints map
  @if map-has-key($breakpoints, $name) {
    // create media query based on the named breakpoint's value
    @media #{inspect(map-get($breakpoints, $name))} {
      @content;
    }
  }

  // Error thrown if named breakpoint is not found in $breakpoints map

    @warn "Unfortunately, no value could be retrieved from `#{$breakpoint}`. "
        + "Please make sure it is defined in `$breakpoints` map.";
